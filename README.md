# Introduction to Machine Learning for Economists

The course provides an introduction to machine learning methods applied to real-life economic and business problems (using the open source software R).. 
Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods as well as reinforcement learning algorithms are covered. 
The focus of the lecture is on supervised machine learning methods, which include penalized regression methods, tree-based methods and neural networks. 
The unsupervised machine learning methods that are discussed include clustering.

The Course is structured as follows:
1. Penalized Regressions
	a. RIDGE
	b. LASSO
	c. Elastic Net
2. Trees and Forests
	a. Trees
	b. Random Forests
3. Applications
	a. Applications: Regression Trees
	b. Applications: Random Forests
4. Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques
	a. K-Means Clustering
